# UK Housing Price Analysis

This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline using a synthetic UK housing price dataset.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and visualizations.

##  Project Files

- `UK_Housing_Regression.ipynb` → Complete notebook with EDA + Regression
- `data/uk_housing_sample.csv` → Sample housing dataset

##  Model Results

- **MAE:** ~£23,415  
- **RMSE:** ~£25,272  
- **R² Score:** -24.5 (as expected from small synthetic data)

##  Key Insights

- Detached homes and Oxford/Cambridge areas show highest prices
- Prices vary significantly by property type and location
- Small dataset used for demonstration purposes
- Visualizations built with Matplotlib and Seaborn

##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## ✅ Next Steps

- Try with full UK housing dataset
- Test Decision Trees or Random Forest models
- Add Power BI dashboards
